// Inmarsat Classic Aero (aviation SATCOM) receiver, ICAO Annex 10 Volume III and
// ARINC 741. 
//
// Aero is the L band satellite protocol for ACARS, the complement to HFDL for oceanic
// aircraft. Three data rates are in scope:
//
//   600 bps    MSK,   600 symbols/s
//   1200 bps   MSK,  1200 symbols/s
//   10500 bps  OQPSK, 5250 symbols/s, 2 bits per symbol
//
// and three channel types:
//
//   P   continuous TDM from the ground station (uplink, GES to aircraft)
//   R   random access bursts from the aircraft (downlink)
//   T   reserved TDMA bursts from the aircraft (downlink)
//
// Unlike HFDL, where the M1 sequence identifies the rate, an Aero channel's rate and
// type are properties of the frequency tuned, so both are settings rather than
// something detected.
//
// P CHANNEL FRAME
//
//   UW (32 bits)          0xE15AE893, the same word at every MSK rate
//   header (16 bits)      uncoded, MSB first:
//                           15-12 format ID (1 on a valid frame)
//                           11-8  super frame marker
//                           7-4   frame counter
//                           3-0   frame counter, repeated
//   data (1152 bits)      coded, or 4992 bits at 10500 bps
//
// which is 1200 channel bits at 600 and 1200 bps - a 2.0 s frame at 600 bps and a
// 1.0 s frame at 1200 - and 5250 bits, a 0.5 s frame, at 10500 bps. Both copies of
// the frame counter are equal in a valid frame, which together with the format ID
// gives two cheap checks that a correlation was not a false alarm.
//
// RECEIVE CHAIN, in order:
//
//   1. matched filter (half sine over two symbol periods for MSK; RRC alpha 1.0 for
//      OQPSK, designed at the symbol rate)
//   2. deinterleave a block of 64 rows x N columns, rows permuted by (i*27) mod 64,
//      reading out[j*64 + i] = in[permute[i]*cols + j]. N is 6, 9 and 78 columns for
//      600, 1200 and 10500 bps, so a 600 bps frame is three blocks, 1200 bps is two
//      and 10500 bps is one
//   3. soft decision Viterbi, K=7 rate 1/2, polynomials 0x6D/0x4F - byte for byte the
//      polynomials HFDL uses, so AcarsHfdlReceiver::viterbiDecode is reused unchanged
//   4. descramble with an additive x^15 + x + 1 LFSR seeded 0x6959, restarted at every
//      frame boundary (and at the start of every burst on R and T)
//   5. pack bits into octets LSB first
//   6. split into signal units and check each CRC
//
// SIGNAL UNITS are 12 octets on P and T (10 of payload then a CRC) and 19 octets on R
// (17 then a CRC). The CRC is CRC-16/X-25 - poly 0x1021, init 0xFFFF, reflected, final
// XOR 0xFFFF - stored little endian in the last two octets. (JAERO's own comment calls
// this GENIBUS; the function it actually calls is the reflected variant, and GENIBUS,
// which it also implements, is never used.)
//
// Octet 0 of a signal unit is its type. Type 0x71 is a user data ISU carrying the AES
// and GES addresses, a queue/reference number pair, the number of SSUs to follow and
// the first two octets of user data; SSUs are typed 0xC0 | SEQNO with SEQNO counting
// down to zero and carry eight more octets each (fewer in the last, per a count in the
// ISU). Reassembled, the user data is FF FF followed by a complete ARINC 618 ACARS
// block - SOH, mode, registration, TAK, label, block id, STX/ETX, text, ETX or ETB,
// a two octet BCS and DEL, with odd parity in bit 7 of every octet except the two
// leading FFs and the BCS. Dropping the two FFs therefore gives exactly the byte
// layout AcarsMessage::decode expects, so nothing has to be synthesised.
//
// MSK DETAIL. Consecutive MSK symbols differ by exactly +-90 degrees, so multiplying
// a symbol by the conjugate of its predecessor and then by -j lands the result on the
// real axis, positive for a one. That is the derotate-to-BPSK view of MSK
// (acarsoqpsk.h:47-50 uses the same identity for VHF ACARS) with the per symbol 90
// degree rotation cancelled in the product, and it means that lane needs no carrier
// recovery at all.
//
// TWO LANES run over every frame and the signal unit CRC arbitrates between them, per
// unit. The differential lane above is the one that always works. The coherent lane
// tracks the carrier with a decision-directed loop seeded from the unique word - a known
// sequence, so a free 33 symbol training burst - and recovers the several dB that
// squaring the noise costs. Neither can lose a unit the other would have got.
//
// Unlike VHF ACARS, whose differential encoding cancels MSK's precoding so its arms
// carry data bits directly, Aero does not pre-encode, so a differential decode still
// follows coherent detection. The two coherent projections are combined with min-sum,
// the standard approximation to the exclusive-or of two log-likelihoods, rather than
// with a raw product that would let one confident symbol inflate an unreliable one.
//
// FRAME TRACKING. A P channel is continuous TDM, so once a frame has been decoded the
// next unique word is due at a known instant. The receiver confirms it inside a half
// symbol window there rather than searching, which both removes almost every false
// correlation and re-locks the symbol timing every frame.
//
// The polarity matters and is easy to get backwards: a one is when the phase does NOT
// reverse. The acquisition correlator cannot catch the mistake, because it correlates
// transitions and takes a magnitude, so an inverted convention correlates just as
// strongly against the unique word and then decodes to nothing at all.
//
// WHAT IS AND IS NOT IMPLEMENTED
//
//   600 and 1200 bps, P channel   implemented and verified against a real recording
//   600 and 1200 bps, T bursts    implemented and verified against a real recording
//   600 and 1200 bps, R bursts    implemented, works end to end, but no recording
//                                 containing R bursts exists to verify it against
//   10500 bps OQPSK               not implemented, rateSupported() returns false
