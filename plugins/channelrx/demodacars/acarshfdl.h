// The air interface is M-PSK at 1800 symbols/s on a 1440 Hz subcarrier above the
// published (suppressed) carrier frequency. A burst is:
//
//   prekey (448 unmodulated symbols)
//   A A               two copies of a 127 bit BPSK synchronisation sequence
//   M1 M2             a 127 bit maximal length sequence whose cyclic shift (8 choices)
//                     encodes the bit rate (300/600/1200/1800 bps) and slot length
//                     (single/double), then its first 15 bits again
//   9 x T             a 15 bit BPSK training sequence, nine times
//   [ 30 data + T ]   data frames of 30 symbols, each followed by one training
//                     sequence, 72 frames (single slot) or 168 (double slot)
//
// Data symbols are BPSK/4PSK/8PSK by bit rate, Gray coded onto absolute (coherent)
// phase. Each data symbol's phase is flipped by pi when a scrambler bit is one: an
// additive x^15 + x + 1 LFSR seeded with 0x6959, restarted every 120 symbols (each
// slot's data length is a multiple of 120, so every burst starts the sequence fresh).
// The user bits are convolutionally encoded (K=7, rate 1/2, polynomials 0x6D/0x4F);
// at 300 bps each encoded chip is transmitted twice (rate 1/4). Chips are interleaved
// through a 40 row table filled down columns (advancing 17 or 23 columns per push,
// single/double slot) and read out skipping 9 rows per pop. The decoded octets (bits
// transmitted LSB first within each octet) form MPDUs (bit 0 of the first octet set)
// or SPDUs (squitters). An MPDU carries LPDUs, each with a CRC-16/X-25 FCS; the MPDU
// header has its own FCS. An LPDU of type 0x0D/0x1D holding an HFNPDU of type 0xFF
// ("enveloped data", i.e. FF FF) carries an ACARS message from the mode character
// onwards - which is what the rest of the ACARS demodulator plugin consumes.
//
// The receiver runs at 4 samples per symbol: matched filter, differential correlation
// acquisition on the first A sequence (CFO-immune, amplitude weighted - the same
// approach as the VDL-2 receiver in acarsvdl2.h), then a coherent decision-directed
// pass through the burst with the reference phasor data-aided over every known
// training sequence, fractional (interpolated) Gardner symbol timing, per-bit
// soft decisions and a soft-decision Viterbi decoder.
