// VDL Mode 2 receiver (ICAO Annex 10 Volume III Part I Chapter 6).
//
// The air interface is D8PSK at 10500 symbols/s: 3 bits per symbol, Gray coded onto the
// phase change between consecutive symbols, pulse shaped with a root raised cosine of
// roll-off 0.6. A burst is a ramp-up, a 16 symbol synchronisation sequence, a 5 symbol
// header (a reserved symbol, a 17 bit transmission length sent LSB first, and 5 bits of
// single-error-correcting FEC), then the data. The whole bit stream after the sync
// sequence is scrambled with an additive x^15 + x + 1 LFSR seeded with 0x6959. The data
// octets are Reed-Solomon RS(255,249) coded (GF(2^8) with polynomial 0x187, first root
// alpha^120) in blocks of up to 249 octets, block-interleaved octet by octet, with the
// final short block carrying 0/2/4/6 parity octets depending on its length. Inside the
// corrected octet stream sit one or more AVLC frames: HDLC-style 0x7E flags with zero-bit
// stuffing, two 4-octet address fields, a link control octet, an information field and a
// CRC-16/X-25 frame check sequence. An information field starting FF FF 01 carries an
// ACARS message (mode character onwards, ending ETX/ETB BCS DEL), which is what the rest
// of the ACARS demodulator plugin consumes; everything else (XID, X.25, supervisory
// frames) is reported as a frame for the GUI to summarise.
//
// Demodulation: the input at 105 kS/s (10 samples per symbol) is matched filtered with a
// root raised cosine, then the receiver works purely on sample phases. Synchronisation
// fits the 16 known preamble phases to the received phases with a mean (carrier phase)
// and slope (carrier frequency) removed by linear regression; the residual power is the
// sync metric and its minimum, located by parabolic interpolation, is the symbol clock.
// Data symbols are then decisions on the phase change per symbol, with a slow decision
// directed frequency update to ride out clock and carrier drift across long bursts.
