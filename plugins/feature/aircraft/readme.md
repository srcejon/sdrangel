<h1>Aircraft Feature Plugin</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The Aircraft feature collates aircraft data from multiple demodulators into a single
aircraft list, and sends the combined aircraft to the [Map feature](../map/readme.md).

Sightings are received from the [ADS-B demodulator](../../channelrx/demodadsb/readme.md)
and the [ACARS demodulator](../../channelrx/demodacars/readme.md) (VHF ACARS, VDL Mode 2
HFDL and Aero modes), from any number of channels in any device set.

Combining protocols matters because each sees a different slice of a flight: ADS-B gives
continuous positions in VHF range, VDL-2 sees logons and CPDLC near airports, and HFDL/Aero
can report an aircraft's position from thousands of kilometres away, hours after it left
ADS-B range. The feature merges these into one aircraft with one track.

<h2>Aircraft identity</h2>

Reports may identify an aircraft by any of:

* 24-bit ICAO address (ADS-B/HFDL/VDL-2 logons),
* registration (VHF ACARS header, or looked up from the ICAO address via the aircraft database),
* flight number / callsign.

The feature merges reports under whichever identities it has seen, cross referencing
registration and ICAO address through the aircraft database. A flight number is
remembered as the aircraft's most recent flight (flights change; the airframe does not).

<h2>Tables and tabs</h2>

The upper half of the window holds the traffic:

* **Aircraft** - every airframe currently being heard, one row each. See the column list
  under Interface below
* **Old Aircraft** - airframes that have gone quiet for longer than the archive timeout.
  They are not forgotten, only no longer current, and they come off the Map
* **Flights** - the flights seen this session, current and past: flight number, aircraft,
  departure and arrival, the four OOOI times, when it was first and last heard, which
  documents it has produced, and which protocols heard it
* **Old Flights** - flights that have finished, and those restored from the last session
* **Weather** - METARs, TAFs, D-ATIS, TWIPs, NOTAMs, PIREPs and SIGMETs carried by ACARS.
  They arrive through whichever aircraft asked for them but describe an **airport**, not
  that aircraft, so they are kept for the session rather than against a flight. Selecting
  a row shows the full report

The lower half describes whatever is selected above:

* **Aircraft** - the photograph and the airframe's details. See Photo below
* **Documents** - flight plans, oceanic clearances, loadsheets, logons and OOOI events,
  collected against the flight they belong to. Selecting one displays its full text
  below the table. The log is kept even after the aircraft it came from has been
  removed. Plain ACARS messages are not collected. CPDLC messages go to the ATC tab instead
* **ATC** - CPDLC (controller-pilot data link) messages across all channels, with the
  protocol, direction (uplink from ATC, downlink from the aircraft), source and
  recipient where known, and the concise message text (e.g. "WILCO")
* **Past Flights** - every flight the selected **aircraft** has operated. Shown only
  while an aircraft is selected. Selecting one of its rows charts that flight's profile
  and draws its track
* **Past Aircraft** - every airframe that has operated the selected **flight number**.
  Shown only while a flight is selected
* **Flight Profile** - see below

Selecting an aircraft or a flight filters the Documents and ATC tables to it.
Route information comes from messages - flight plans, OOOI events, oceanic
clearances - or, where none has revealed it, from the callsign-to-route database.

<h2>Flight profile</h2>

The Flight Profile tab charts the selected flight's altitude (left axis) and speed
(right axis) against time, showing the flight profile - climb, cruise and descent - built
from all protocols and kept with the flight in the session database.

<h2>Photo</h2>

The first of the message tabs, titled Aircraft, shows a photograph of the selected
aircraft from [planespotters.net](https://www.planespotters.net/) headed by its
registration and the country flag, with the airline's logo beneath it and a table of what
the OpenSky database knows about the airframe beside it. Clicking the photograph opens it
on planespotters.net

<h2>Chart</h2>

The chart plots the message rate per protocol (and in total) over time. Click a legend
entry to show or hide a series. It is shown and hidden with the chart button, and
appears at the bottom of the splitter beneath the tables rather than in a tab, so the
rate can be watched at the same time as the traffic producing it. Right click the
button to clear the data.

<h2>Statistics</h2>

The statistics table can be shown and hidden with the statistic button. 
Right click the button to reset the records.

Every figure is given twice, side by side: for this session and for all time, each with
who set it and when. 

* **Maximum range**, one row per protocol - the furthest aircraft heard on ADS-B, ACARS,
  VDL-2, HFDL and Aero. Per protocol rather than as one figure because the protocols are
  not comparable: line of sight VHF, HF skywave and an L band satellite downlink have
  nothing to do with one another, and a single "maximum range" would only ever show the
  satellite
* **Fastest ground speed** and **Highest altitude**, with the aircraft that set each
* **Most aircraft at once** - the largest number heard within any 15 minute window
* **Aircraft heard** - how many different airframes
* **Total messages**, then one row per protocol giving that protocol's count and its
  share of the total. The share is of that scope's own total, so a protocol that has been
  quiet today shows its reduced share against its long run one rather than against nothing
* **Listening time** and **Messages per minute**

Ranges depend on the receiver position being right: see the Dist (km) column below for
where that comes from.

<h2>Settings</h2>

The gear button opens the settings dialog.

**Timeouts**

* Archive after (mins) - how long without a report before an aircraft moves to the Old
  Aircraft table and comes off the Map.
* Keep for (days) - how long archived aircraft and their flights are kept in the session
  database before being discarded. Zero keeps them forever, at the cost of a database
  that grows without limit
* ADS-B position for (mins) - how long an aircraft stays on the Map after its last ADS-B
  position
* ACARS position for (mins) - the same for a position from ACARS, VDL-2, HFDL or Aero.
  Two figures rather than one because the protocols report at wildly different rates:
  ADS-B about once a second, where an oceanic position report can be the only one for
  many minutes.

**Session database** - the file the aircraft, flights and messages are saved in.

**Receive aircraft data from** - which demodulators this feature accepts reports from.
Unticked ones are ignored.

**Use airline callsigns in Map labels** - writes the flight on the Map the way it is
spoken on the radio rather than the way it is transmitted: SPEEDBIRD 123 instead of
BAW123, using the airline's radio callsign from the airline database. 

**Show the maximum range record on the Map** - keeps the aircraft that set the all time
maximum range record permanently on the Map, drawn at the position it was in when it set
it rather than wherever it is now. The
bubble names the aircraft, the distance, the protocol it was heard on and when. It is the
best record across all protocols, and it stays until the record is beaten, the records are
reset, or this is turned off.

A record set before positions were kept alongside them has nowhere to be drawn, and in
that case nothing is drawn until the record is beaten. Not the furthest record that
*could* be placed: that would put a marker on the Map giving one distance while the
statistics table gave another. The log says so when it happens.

**Favour airline livery over aircraft type (3D map)** - when no 3D model exists of the
right type in the right livery, prefer a similar aircraft in the correct livery over an
exact type in the wrong one. 

**Livery aircraft icons (2D map)** - display aircraft on the 2D map using icons showing
their airline's livery, instead of black icons. The icon follows the aircraft's matched
3D model, so this requires the 3D models to have been downloaded via the Map feature.
Aircraft without a matching model are displayed with a white version of the plain icon.

<h2>Notifications</h2>

The notifications dialog holds rules matched against each aircraft's ICAO address,
registration, flight or type with a regular expression. When an aircraft first matches
a rule, the rule's speech text is read aloud and/or its command is executed, with
${icao} ${reg} ${flight} ${type} ${protocol} substituted. Each rule fires at most once
per aircraft.

<h2>Session persistence</h2>

The collated aircraft, flights, documents and ATC log are saved to a SQLite database
(aircraft.db in the application data directory) every minute and on exit, and restored
when the feature is next opened. On restore, aircraft that have not been heard within
the removal timeout are pruned, while the document and ATC logs are restored in full;
restored aircraft with positions reappear on the Map with their full tracks. 

The all time figures are kept in the preset rather than in that database, because they
are a property of the receiving setup rather than of the traffic.

The one exception is the all time aircraft count, which cannot be a running total: the
same airframe heard on two days has to count once, so it needs the set of which
airframes have been heard rather than a number. That set is a table in the database, and
it is the only thing there that is never pruned - so the count keeps growing after the
aircraft themselves have aged out. 

Right clicking the statistics button offers to reset either half. Resetting the session
starts it again from that moment without touching the all time figures. Resetting all
time also clears the record of which airframes have been heard.

<h2>Finding things</h2>

The Find box highlights the next row matching what is typed, stepping through the matches
on each press of Enter. It searches the ICAO address, registration, type, flight number,
airline and departure and arrival airports at once, or a single one of them when the
column selector beside it is set to something other than All. The text turns red when
nothing matches.

<h2>Context menus</h2>

Right clicking a cell in any of the tables offers, as they apply to that cell:

* **Copy** the cell's contents to the clipboard
* **Find on map** - centre the Map on that aircraft
* **Display flight** - jump to that flight in the Flights table, from the aircraft flying it
* **Display aircraft** - jump the other way, to the airframe operating a flight

<h2>Map</h2>

Aircraft with a position are sent to the Map feature, named by registration when known.

When an Aircraft feature is present, the ADS-B and ACARS demodulators stop sending
aircraft to the Map themselves - this feature is the single source, so each aircraft
appears once, with data combined from every demodulator that hears it. ADS-B sightings
pass through the demodulator's fully-built map item, so the 3D model, animations and
the complete aircraft state driving the Map's PFD display are preserved, with the
combined track and route information added. Without an Aircraft feature, the
demodulators send to the Map directly, as before.

The map item carries:

* An icon matching the aircraft type, rotated to point along the track,
* The full track accumulated across all protocols - the whole history survives coverage
  gaps, so a flight tracked on ADS-B and picked up again hours later on HFDL shows one
  continuous track,
* A popup headed by a side view of the type in the operator's livery and the country
  flag, followed by registration, flight, aircraft type,
  departure/arrival airports and the route where messages have revealed them, and the
  protocols and frequencies the **current flight** has been heard on. 

The routes an aircraft has been given are drawn too - a filed flight plan and an oceanic
clearance alike - as a line through the waypoints with a marker at each one. A flight
plan comes from an FPN message or a position report's route insert; a clearance from an
oceanic clearance or its readback. Both are bookended with the departure and arrival
airports so the line starts and finishes somewhere recognisable, and the route's popup
carries the message that filed it, which is where the clearance number, entry time,
flight level and Mach are.

Each name is resolved against the airport, waypoint and navaid databases - four
characters is an airport, five a waypoint, three a VOR or NDB ident, and seven an oceanic
position such as 5530N - and any that cannot be resolved is dropped. A route is drawn
once, when it is filed, and is left on the Map after the flight is archived: it is a
record of where the aircraft was going.

Stale positions from stored performance log dumps (seen with HFDL) are ignored: a
position timestamped well before the newest known position for that aircraft does not
move it.

Aircraft are removed from the table and the Map after a configurable number of minutes
without a report.

<h3>8: Settings</h3>

Opens the settings dialog - timeouts, the session database, which demodulators to accept
reports from, and the Map options. See Settings above.

<h3>Aircraft table</h3>

The table shows one row per aircraft:

* ICAO - 24-bit ICAO address, when known
* Reg - Aircraft registration
* Type - Aircraft type (ICAO type designator) from the OpenSky database
* Flight - Most recent flight number / callsign
* Airline - Airline logo, or operator name when no logo is available
* Sideview - Aircraft silhouette, coloured per airline where available
* Country - Flag of the country of registration
* Lat, Lon - Latest position in degrees
* Dist (km) - Great circle distance from the receiver to the aircraft. Measured from
  the position of the **device the report arrived on** when that device knows where it
  is - a remote SDR reports the position of the server, not of you - and from
  Preferences > My Position otherwise. So the figure always means "from the antenna
  that heard it", which matters when receiving from somewhere other than where you are
* Alt (ft) - Altitude in feet
* Hdg - Heading or track in degrees
* Spd (kn) - Speed in knots
* Protocols - Every protocol and frequency the **airframe** has been received on
  (e.g. "ACARS 131.725; HFDL 5.720"), over every flight it has made and for as long as
  it is kept. The Flights table has a column of the same name holding the same thing for
  a single flight, and that is the one the Map shows - an airframe heard on HFDL over
  the Atlantic last month is not being heard on HFDL now, so naming it beside the
  aircraft on the Map would be wrong.
* Msgs - Number of messages received
* Last seen - Time of the last report

<h3>Flights table</h3>

The table shows one row per flight, and the Old Flights table the same columns for
flights that have finished:

* Flight - Flight number / callsign
* Reg - Registration of the airframe that flew it
* From, To - Departure and arrival airports
* Out, Off, On, In - The four OOOI times: off the gate, airborne, landed, on the gate
* First seen, Last seen - When the flight was first and last heard
* LS, OC, FP - A tick where the flight has produced a loadsheet, an oceanic clearance or
  a flight plan. Blank where it has not, rather than a cross: a column of crosses is as
  loud as a column of ticks, which makes the ticks harder to pick out
* Docs - Number of documents collected
* Protocols - Protocols and frequencies **this flight** has been heard on. The Aircraft
  table's column of the same name is the airframe's, over every flight it has made

Columns in either table can be reordered by dragging, hidden via the right-click header
menu, and either table sorted by clicking a header. Widths and order are saved with the
preset.
